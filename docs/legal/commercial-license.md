# Commercial Licensing

HXML is available under **AGPL-3.0-or-later** for open-source use.

If your company needs to use HXML in a proprietary/closed-source product,
contact the maintainer for a separate commercial license.

## Contact

- Licensing contact: licensing@hxml.dev (planned)
- Interim contact: open a "Commercial licensing" issue on GitHub
- GitHub: https://github.com/instrumentalslover/hxml/issues/new

## Notes

- Open-source usage remains available under AGPL.
- Commercial terms are negotiated case-by-case.
- This file is informational and does not itself grant a commercial license.
- External contributions are accepted under `cla-individual.md` to enable dual licensing.
